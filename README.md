## üìö Key Concepts

### Actions

Actions are the runnable code inside of a function. Basically, is just a normal function.

They have some types:
- RunnableAction -> Has no Input and Output
- SupplierAction -> Has no Input but have Output
- ConsumerAction -> Has Input but don't have Output
- FunctionAction -> Has Input and Output

Action only have 1 input, we recommend you send DTO Records to Actions as Parameters.

### Auto Retainer

Auto Retainer is compatible with all exceptions on .NET, but you need to specify a limit for Retries.
You can define AutoRetainer on TrierBuilder

```csharp
Trier<VoidType?, ReturnType>.CreateInstance(action, null)
    .AutoRetryOn<MyException>(5); // Retry on MyException with a limit of 5 times
    
```

### Exception Handler

CAE by default, only work with MappedExceptions. So we need to transform our Generic Exception to a MappedException. For this, we have the IUnexpectedExceptionHandler interface.

Your will need create our own implementation for this.
